# RoboCup-Soccer-Robots, Path planning Algorithms in Static and Dynamic Synarios in Simulator.
This project focuses on the design and implementation of decision-making algorithms and World Models for a RoboCup Small Size League (SSL) robotic team. The primary objective is to enhance the team’s ability to navigate dynamic environments, avoid obstacles, and execute strategic actions in real time. The foundation of the project is grounded in principles of generative modeling and learning-based robotic systems.

Inspired by the seminal work “World Models” by David Ha and Jürgen Schmidhuber, this project explores the use of generative models to simulate complex, dynamic environments. By leveraging these models, robots are equipped to predict environmental changes with high accuracy, adapt efficiently to unforeseen scenarios, and optimize their actions for competitive performance.

A robust World Model will be developed to integrate sensory inputs, prior experiences, and environmental data, enabling robots to perform real-time strategic planning and execution. The model will be evaluated through both simulation (using grSim) and real-world implementations in the SSL context. Two key path-planning algorithms, the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and the Voronoi Planner, will be employed to facilitate obstacle avoidance and goal-directed navigation.

This research will culminate in a comparative analysis of these algorithms, assessing their performance in static and dynamic scenarios, including:
1. Static Ball Scenario: Robots navigate toward a stationary ball while avoiding static obstacles (opponent robots).
2. Dynamic Ball Scenario: Robots adapt to a ball moving dynamically across the field, recalculating paths in real time while avoiding static obstacles.

The project aims to contribute through simulations in grSim and comparative analyses, this project aims to contribute to the development of advanced robotic systems capable of autonomous decision-making, further advancing multi-robot collaboration and intelligent systems within competitive robotics.
